# voting_system
Hello!!
This system is easy to use and has heavy impact on traditional voting systems in any associations 
It can be used as a single device system or you can change the apache server port to the wifi port of your current network
Finally to use this website on a third device all you need is to input the IP of host device or you can give it a name and thus you can vote from mobiles, pcs, etc
